### **Features**<br/>
Create new Ethereum wallets<br/>
Store private keys securely (using local storage)<br/>
Generate Ethereum addresses<br/>
Create simple transactions<br/>
Basic error handling and validation<br/>

### **Getting Started**<br/>
To run this application locally:<br/>

### **Clone the repository**<br/>
> ```git clone https://github.com/Unnati-Gupta24/Ethereum-Mini-Wallet.git```<br/> 

Navigate to the project directory:<br/>
> ```cd Ethereum-Mini-Wallet```<br/>

### **Usage**<br/>
Once the application is running, you can access it through your web browser.<br/> Follow these steps:<br/>

Open a new tab in your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 (or whatever port your server is running on).<br/>
You will see a simple interface with options to create a new wallet, view existing wallets, and perform other operations.<br/>

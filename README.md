ETHEREUM MINI WALLET

Introduction
This project is an implementation of a minimal Ethereum wallet application. It allows users to create new wallets, store private keys securely, and interact with basic Ethereum functionality such as generating addresses and creating transactions.

Features
Create new Ethereum wallets
Store private keys securely (using local storage)
Generate Ethereum addresses
Create simple transactions
Basic error handling and validation

Getting Started
To run this application locally:

Clone the repository:
```git clone https://github.com/Unnati-Gupta24/Ethereum-Mini-Wallet.git```
Navigate to the project directory:
```cd Ethereum-Mini-Wallet```
Install dependencies:
```npm install```
Run the application:
```npm start```

Usage
Once the application is running, you can access it through your web browser. Follow these steps:

Open a new tab in your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 (or whatever port your server is running on).
You will see a simple interface with options to create a new wallet, view existing wallets, and perform other operations.
To create a new wallet, click on "Create New Wallet" and follow the prompts.
To view your wallet details, including the public address and private key, click on "View Wallet".
You can also practice sending transactions by clicking on "Send Transaction".
Please note that this is a simplified version of an Ethereum wallet and should not be used for real-world 
applications or storing valuable cryptocurrencies. Always keep your private keys secure and never share them.
